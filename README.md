# image-recognition-frontend
This is the front end for a React app that allows interactivity with the <a href="https://www.clarifai.com/">Clarifai</a> image recognition API.  The application in conjunction with the backend, (<a href='https://github.com/ggroce/image-recognition-backend'>www.github.com/ggroce/image-recognition-backend</a>), handles user authorization and responses from the Clarifai API, providing visual feedback on submitted images.
